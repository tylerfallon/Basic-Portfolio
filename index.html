			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hello, my name is Tyler Fallon. For my entire life, I have had the mentality of a "builder". At an early age, I became acquainted with HTML and CSS, along with Adobe Creative Suites, which allowed me to create and manage a relatively large-scale forum. I have a passion for surfing and electronic music, which I have been producing as a hobby for the past 6 years. As an aspiring web developer, I am currently enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and am excited about where this field will take me.</p>
